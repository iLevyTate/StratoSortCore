ABSTRACT
CRISPR-Cas9 and its next-generation variants (base editors, prime editors) have
advanced from laboratory tools to clinical therapeutics at unprecedented speed.
As of mid-2025, 87 clinical trials involving CRISPR-based interventions are
registered globally, spanning oncology, hematology, ophthalmology, and rare
genetic disorders. This review catalogs the current trial landscape, analyzes
safety and efficacy data from completed Phase I/II studies, and examines the
evolving regulatory frameworks in the US, EU, and China.

1. APPROVED THERAPIES

Casgevy (exagamglogene autotemcel) — Vertex/CRISPR Therapeutics
  Indication: Sickle cell disease (SCD) and transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia
  Mechanism: Ex vivo editing of BCL11A enhancer in autologous HSCs
  Approval: FDA (Dec 2023), EMA (Feb 2024), MHRA (Nov 2023)
  Outcomes (36-month follow-up):
    SCD: 97% of patients (29/30) free of vaso-occlusive crises
    β-thal: 93% of patients (28/30) transfusion-independent
  Safety: Myeloablative conditioning (busulfan) remains primary risk factor

2. PHASE III TRIALS (Selected)

Trial ID     | Sponsor       | Indication         | Editor    | Status
-------------|---------------|--------------------|-----------|---------
NCT06128252  | Editas Med    | LCA10 (blindness)  | Cas9      | Enrolling
NCT05951205  | Intellia      | ATTR amyloidosis   | Cas9      | Phase III
NCT06234100  | Beam Ther.    | SCD (base edit)    | ABE8e     | Phase II/III
NCT06301920  | Prime Med.    | Wilson disease      | PE2       | Phase II
NCT06445500  | Caribou Bio   | r/r B-cell NHL     | Cas12a    | Phase II

3. IN VIVO vs. EX VIVO APPROACHES

                    | Ex Vivo                  | In Vivo
--------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------
Delivery            | Electroporation of cells | LNP or AAV to target organ
Editing efficiency  | >90% (controlled)        | 30–70% (tissue-dependent)
Off-target control  | High (screened pre-infusion)| Lower (limited monitoring)
Cost per patient    | $1.5–2.5M                | Est. $500K–1M
Scalability         | Limited (autologous)     | Higher (off-the-shelf)

Intellia's NTLA-2001 (in vivo liver CRISPR for transthyretin amyloidosis)
demonstrated 93% reduction in serum TTR protein at 2 years—the strongest
in vivo editing result to date. This has catalyzed a wave of liver-targeted
programs using lipid nanoparticle (LNP) delivery.

4. SAFETY LANDSCAPE

4.1 Off-Target Editing
  GUIDE-seq and CIRCLE-seq nominated <5 off-target sites per therapeutic
  gRNA. No clinical adverse events attributable to off-target editing have
  been reported through 2025.

4.2 Genotoxicity
  Large deletions at on-target sites (>1 kb) detected at 1–5% frequency
  in preclinical studies. Clinical significance unclear; long-term follow-up
  (15 years per FDA mandate) ongoing.

4.3 Immune Response
  Anti-Cas9 antibodies detected in 58% of patients (pre-existing immunity
  from S. pyogenes exposure). Clinical impact: negligible for ex vivo
  approaches; potential concern for repeat in vivo dosing.

4.4 Reported Serious Adverse Events (all CRISPR trials, 2019–2025)
  - Myeloablative conditioning toxicity: 12 events (expected)
  - Cytokine release syndrome (CAR-T + CRISPR): 8 events (Grade 3+)
  - Editing-related SAEs: 0 confirmed

5. NEXT-GENERATION EDITORS IN THE CLINIC

Base Editors (BE4max, ABE8e)
  Single nucleotide changes without double-strand breaks
  Beam Therapeutics BEAM-101 for SCD: 80% HbF induction (Phase I, n=6)

Prime Editors (PE2, PEmax)
  Search-and-replace editing (insertions, deletions, all 12 substitutions)
  Prime Medicine PM359 for chronic granulomatous disease: IND filed Q2 2025

Epigenome Editors (CRISPRoff/CRISPRon)
  Heritable gene silencing/activation without DNA sequence changes
  Chroma Medicine: preclinical for PCSK9 silencing (hypercholesterolemia)

6. REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS

FDA (United States)
  - Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation available
  - 15-year follow-up required for all gene-modified cell products
  - Expedited review pathways utilized for SCD and β-thalassemia

EMA (European Union)
  - ATMP classification; centralized approval via CAT committee
  - Conditional Marketing Authorization used for Casgevy
  - Post-authorization safety study (PASS) required for 10 years

NMPA (China)
  - 67 CRISPR trials registered (largest national portfolio)
  - Expedited pathway for rare diseases (< 50,000 patients in China)
  - Data sharing agreements with WHO for global harmonization

7. COST AND ACCESS

Casgevy list price: $2.2M (US). Budget impact models suggest cost-effectiveness
at WTP thresholds of $150K/QALY for SCD (given lifetime hospitalization costs
of $1.6M). Outcomes-based contracts with payers are active in 6 US health systems.

8. CONCLUSIONS
CRISPR therapeutics have established a strong safety record across >500 treated
patients. The next frontier is in vivo editing for common diseases (cardiovascular,
metabolic). Success will depend on: improved delivery vehicles, reduced immunogenicity,
and equitable access models for high-cost therapies.
