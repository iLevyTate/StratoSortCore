ABSTRACT
The AlphaFold revolution has transformed structural biology, providing predicted
structures for over 200 million proteins. This review examines the technical
foundations of deep learning-based protein structure prediction, evaluates
accuracy benchmarks across protein families, and surveys emerging clinical
applications in drug discovery, enzyme engineering, and genetic variant
interpretation.

1. EVOLUTION OF STRUCTURE PREDICTION METHODS

Era         | Method              | Median GDT-TS (CASP) | Year
------------|---------------------|----------------------|------
Homology    | SWISS-MODEL         |    ~50               | 2000
Threading   | I-TASSER            |    ~60               | 2010
Co-evolution| RaptorX Contact     |    ~65               | 2016
Deep Learning| AlphaFold 2        |    ~92               | 2020
Diffusion   | RFdiffusion         |    ~88 (de novo)     | 2023
Foundation  | ESMFold / OpenFold  |    ~87               | 2023
Multi-state | AlphaFold 3         |    ~90 (complexes)   | 2024

AlphaFold 2's breakthrough at CASP14 achieved atomic-level accuracy (median
GDT-TS 92.4) for the first time, effectively solving the single-chain protein
structure prediction problem for most globular proteins.

2. TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

2.1 AlphaFold 2 (Evoformer + Structure Module)
  Input: MSA (multiple sequence alignment) + template structures
  Architecture: 48 Evoformer blocks (pair + MSA representations)
  Output: 3D coordinates + per-residue confidence (pLDDT)
  Training: ~170,000 PDB structures + self-distillation
  Inference: ~3 minutes per protein (A100 GPU)

2.2 ESMFold (Language Model Approach)
  Input: Single sequence (no MSA required)
  Architecture: ESM-2 protein language model (15B parameters) + folding head
  Trade-off: 60× faster than AlphaFold 2, slightly lower accuracy
  Best for: Rapid screening of millions of sequences (metagenomics)

2.3 AlphaFold 3 (Diffusion-Based)
  Input: Protein + ligand + nucleic acid + ion complexes
  Architecture: Diffusion module replaces structure module
  Advance: Predicts protein-ligand binding poses (drug discovery critical)
  Limitation: Not open-source; available only via AlphaFold Server

3. ACCURACY ANALYSIS BY PROTEIN FAMILY

Protein Family          | Avg pLDDT | % Residues > 90 pLDDT | Known Challenges
------------------------|-----------|----------------------|------------------
Globular enzymes        |   91.2    |       78%            | Active site loops
Membrane proteins       |   76.4    |       42%            | TM helix packing
Intrinsically disordered|   38.1    |        4%            | No stable structure
Antibody CDR loops      |   72.8    |       31%            | H3 loop diversity
Repeat proteins         |   88.6    |       71%            | Register shifts
Metalloenzymes          |   85.3    |       62%            | Metal coordination

4. DRUG DISCOVERY APPLICATIONS

4.1 Virtual Screening
  AlphaFold structures used for docking campaigns when experimental
  structures unavailable. Success rate: ~60% of AF2 structures yield
  docking enrichment comparable to crystal structures (DUD-E benchmark).

4.2 Fragment-Based Drug Design
  Relay Therapeutics: Used AlphaFold 3 + molecular dynamics to design
  RAS(ON) inhibitors. Lead compound RLY-2608 (PI3Kα): Phase II ongoing.

4.3 Antibody Design
  De novo antibody design using RFdiffusion + ProteinMPNN:
  - Designed binders against 12 viral targets in silico
  - 8/12 confirmed binding (Kd < 100 nM) experimentally
  - 3 advanced to preclinical development (SARS-CoV-2, influenza, RSV)

5. ENZYME ENGINEERING

5.1 Directed Evolution Guided by Structure Prediction
  Predict mutant structures → rank by stability (ΔΔG) → select for screening
  Reduces experimental screening 10–100×

5.2 Industrial Applications
  - PET-degrading enzyme (PETase): 5.4× activity improvement via
    computationally guided mutations (published Tournier et al., 2025)
  - Carbon-capture enzyme (carbonic anhydrase): thermostability +22°C

6. GENETIC VARIANT INTERPRETATION

AlphaMissense (Cheng et al., 2023) classifies all possible human missense
variants using AlphaFold structural context:
  - 89% pathogenic variants correctly classified (ClinVar benchmark)
  - 71 million variants scored across the human proteome
  - Adopted by ClinGen for Variant Curation Expert Panel workflows

Clinical Impact: Reduces VUS (variant of uncertain significance) rate by
estimated 25% in clinical exome/genome sequencing reports.

7. LIMITATIONS AND OPEN CHALLENGES

1. Conformational ensembles: Current methods predict one static structure;
   proteins exist in dynamic equilibrium of multiple states.
2. Post-translational modifications: Glycosylation, phosphorylation effects
   on structure poorly captured.
3. Large complexes: Ribosome-scale assemblies (~4 MDa) exceed current
   memory and accuracy limits.
4. Training data bias: PDB is enriched for crystallizable, well-ordered
   proteins; predictions for underrepresented families less reliable.

8. CONCLUSIONS
Deep learning has fundamentally accelerated structural biology. The next
decade will focus on: (a) multi-state prediction capturing protein dynamics,
(b) end-to-end drug design pipelines integrating structure prediction with
molecular generation, and (c) democratizing access through efficient open-
source models running on consumer hardware.
