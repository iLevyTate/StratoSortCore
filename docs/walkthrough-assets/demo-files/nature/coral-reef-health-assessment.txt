Coral Reef Health Assessment — Indo-Pacific Survey 2025

Marine Biological Laboratory | Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution
Lead: Dr. Anika Chowdhury, Reef Systems Group
Survey Period: March 15 – June 30, 2025

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
We conducted 312 belt-transect surveys across 14 reef sites in the Coral Triangle
region (Indonesia, Philippines, Papua New Guinea). Overall live coral cover averaged
38.2% (±6.7), a modest recovery from the 2023 bleaching event low of 31.4%.

SITE HIGHLIGHTS

Raja Ampat, Indonesia
  Live coral cover: 52.1%  |  Bleaching prevalence: 4.2%
  Dominant genera: Acropora, Porites, Montipora
  Fish biomass: 184 kg/ha (above regional mean)
  Notes: Marine Protected Area enforcement strong; illegal blast fishing
  incidents down 60% year-over-year

Tubbataha Reefs, Philippines
  Live coral cover: 41.8%  |  Bleaching prevalence: 8.1%
  Dominant genera: Pocillopora, Porites
  Fish biomass: 127 kg/ha
  Notes: Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) outbreak contained via diver removal
  program; 2,300 COTS removed Q2 2025

Kimbe Bay, Papua New Guinea
  Live coral cover: 29.4%  |  Bleaching prevalence: 12.6%
  Dominant genera: Porites, Pavona
  Fish biomass: 89 kg/ha (below threshold)
  Notes: Sedimentation from upstream logging remains primary stressor

METHODOLOGY
  Transect protocol: 50 m × 2 m belt, point-intercept at 50 cm intervals
  Depth range: 3–15 m
  Photo quadrats: 0.5 m² per station, 4 stations per transect
  Water quality: YSI EXO2 sonde (temperature, salinity, turbidity, DO, pH)

THERMAL STRESS INDEX
  Degree Heating Weeks (DHW) peaked at 6.2 in southern Philippines (April 2025),
  triggering Alert Level 1. Raja Ampat remained below 3.0 DHW throughout the survey.

RECOMMENDATIONS
1. Expand COTS early-detection buoys to 6 additional Philippines sites.
2. Establish sediment traps in Kimbe Bay watershed; coordinate with forestry ministry.
3. Deploy autonomous reef-monitoring cameras (ARMS units) at all 14 sites for
   year-round benthic cover tracking.
4. Prioritize genetic sampling of heat-tolerant Acropora colonies for assisted gene
   flow pilot program.
