Yellowstone Wolf Reintroduction — 30-Year Ecological Update

Authors: Dr. James Whitfield, Dr. Rosa Delgado
Report Date: September 2025

OVERVIEW
Thirty years after the landmark 1995 reintroduction of gray wolves (Canis lupus) to
Yellowstone National Park, the ecosystem continues to demonstrate cascading ecological
benefits. The 2025 winter census confirmed 108 wolves in 10 packs across the Greater
Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE).

PACK CENSUS (Winter 2025)

Pack Name          | Territory          | Adults | Pups | Total
-------------------|--------------------|--------|------|------
Lamar Canyon       | Lamar Valley       |    9   |   4  |  13
Junction Butte     | Slough Creek       |   11   |   5  |  16
Mollie's           | Pelican Valley     |    8   |   3  |  11
Wapiti Lake        | Hayden Valley      |    7   |   2  |   9
8-Mile             | Northern Range     |   10   |   4  |  14
Prospect Peak      | Mirror Plateau     |    5   |   2  |   7
Canyon              | Canyon Village     |    6   |   3  |   9
Bechler            | SW Yellowstone     |    7   |   3  |  10
Snake River        | Southern Range     |    6   |   2  |   8
Phantom Lake       | Central Plateau    |    8   |   3  |  11

TROPHIC CASCADE METRICS

Elk (Cervus canadensis) Population
  Northern herd estimate: 6,200 (down from ~20,000 pre-wolf)
  Calf-to-cow ratio: 28:100 (healthy; pre-wolf was 45:100 with overgrazing)
  Behavioral shift: Elk spend 60% less time in riparian zones vs. pre-wolf era

Vegetation Recovery
  Willow (Salix spp.) canopy height: +340% in Lamar Valley since 1995
  Aspen (Populus tremuloides) recruitment: measurable in 68% of monitored stands
  Cottonwood regeneration: observed in 12 of 15 permanent plots along rivers

Beaver (Castor canadensis) Response
  Active beaver colonies in northern Yellowstone: 12 (zero in 1995)
  Dam count (Slough Creek drainage): 23
  Pond surface area created: ~4.8 hectares

Scavenger Guild
  Raven, magpie, bald eagle, and grizzly bear all benefit from wolf-killed
  carcasses during winter. Carcass availability index: 3.2× pre-wolf levels.

HUMAN DIMENSIONS
  Wolf-livestock depredation claims (GYE, 2024): 18 confirmed cattle, 6 sheep
  Compensation paid: $127,400 (Defenders of Wildlife fund)
  Wolf-watching tourism economic impact: est. $82 million/year for gateway communities

GENETIC HEALTH
  Heterozygosity (He): 0.71 (stable; founder population He = 0.74)
  Effective population size (Ne): ~64
  Recommendation: Evaluate genetic connectivity with Idaho/Montana meta-population
  via corridor analysis.

FUTURE PRIORITIES
1. Expand GPS collar deployment to 30% of adults for fine-scale territory mapping.
2. Continue long-term vegetation plots (30+ year dataset now globally significant).
3. Model climate-change impacts on elk migration timing and wolf prey availability.
4. Coordinate with state agencies on buffer-zone management outside park boundaries.
