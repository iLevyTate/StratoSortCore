ANNUAL MINIMUM EXTENT
The 2025 Arctic sea ice minimum extent was recorded on September 14 at
4.08 million km², ranking as the 4th lowest in the 46-year satellite record
(1979–2025).

RANKING OF LOWEST SEPTEMBER MINIMUMS
  1. 2012:  3.39 million km²
  2. 2020:  3.74 million km²
  3. 2019:  4.01 million km²
  4. 2025:  4.08 million km²  ← This year
  5. 2023:  4.12 million km²

The 1981–2010 median September minimum was 6.30 million km². The 2025 value
represents a 35% departure from this climatological baseline.

ICE THICKNESS AND VOLUME
CryoSat-2 and ICESat-2 altimetry indicate mean ice thickness of 1.24 m across
the Arctic basin (September average), continuing the long-term thinning trend
of -0.13 m/decade. Estimated total ice volume: 4,150 km³ (PIOMAS model),
compared to ~12,000 km³ in the early 1980s.

East Siberian Sea   |   280,000 km²   |    -38%            | -12%/dec
Laptev Sea          |   125,000 km²   |    -55%            | -20%/dec
Kara Sea            |   165,000 km²   |    -33%            | -11%/dec
Barents Sea         |    48,000 km²   |    -61%            | -22%/dec
Central Arctic      | 2,960,000 km²   |    -22%            |  -8%/dec

CONTRIBUTING FACTORS

1. Atmospheric Circulation: A persistent Arctic dipole pattern (high pressure
   over Beaufort, low over Eurasia) promoted ice transport out of the Transpolar
   Drift Stream through Fram Strait.

2. Ocean Heat: Atlantic Water inflow through the Barents Sea Opening was 15%
   above the 2000–2020 mean, contributing to early melt onset in the Barents
   and Kara Seas (May 8 vs. median May 22).

3. Albedo Feedback: Early melt pond formation (detected May 15 via MODIS)
   reduced surface albedo from 0.82 to 0.45, amplifying solar absorption
   during the 24-hour daylight period.

IMPLICATIONS FOR WILDLIFE
  - Polar bear (Ursus maritimus): Extended ice-free season in western Hudson
    Bay reached 168 days (record; mean 135 days), increasing nutritional stress.
  - Walrus (Odobenus rosmarus): Haul-out events on Alaskan coast began August 2
    (2 weeks earlier than 2010–2020 mean).
  - Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida): Under-ice habitat area reduced ~30%;
    northward range shift of 200 km observed in acoustic surveys.

SHIPPING AND GEOPOLITICAL NOTES
The Northern Sea Route was ice-free for transit without icebreaker support from
July 28 to October 12 (77 days), the second-longest open window recorded. Total
transits in 2025: 127 vessels (up from 92 in 2024).

FORECAST
NSIDC seasonal forecast models project a 30–40% probability that September
minimum extent will fall below 3.5 million km² within the next 5 years, and a
>50% probability of an effectively ice-free Arctic (<1 million km²) by 2040.
