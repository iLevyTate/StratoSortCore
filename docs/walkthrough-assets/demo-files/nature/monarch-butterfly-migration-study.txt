Monarch Butterfly Migration Patterns — Field Report 2025

Principal Investigator: Dr. Elena Vasquez, Department of Entomology
Location: Pacific Grove Monarch Sanctuary, California
Season: October 2025 — February 2026

ABSTRACT
This report documents the annual overwintering aggregation of Danaus plexippus
(monarch butterfly) at the Pacific Grove sanctuary. Our team recorded an estimated
24,600 individuals—a 14% increase over the 2024 season—clustered primarily in
Monterey pine and eucalyptus groves within a 2.3-hectare core area.

KEY OBSERVATIONS

Temperature & Microclimate
  Average canopy temperature: 12.4 °C (±1.1)
  Average humidity: 78% RH
  Wind speed at cluster height: < 2 m/s

Population Dynamics
  Peak arrival: November 8–14
  Peak departure: February 18–22
  Mortality events: 2 frost events (Jan 3, Jan 17) caused ~3% attrition

Tagging Results
  Tags deployed: 1,200 (wing-adhesive alphanumeric)
  Re-sights from northern sites: 47 individuals traced to Oregon/Washington
  Longest confirmed flight: 2,840 km (Ashland, OR → Pacific Grove, CA)

HABITAT NOTES
The primary roosting trees—Monterey pines aged 60–80 years—showed signs of pitch
canker (Fusarium circinatum). Three mature trees were removed after the 2024 season,
reducing canopy cover by ~8%. Supplemental eucalyptus plantings (2022 cohort) have
reached 6 m height and are beginning to provide viable alternative roost sites.

Milkweed (Asclepias fascicularis) restoration plots along the coastal corridor showed
a 22% increase in stem density, which correlates with higher early-season oviposition
rates observed in the central valley waypoints.

CONSERVATION RECOMMENDATIONS
1. Continue annual Fusarium monitoring and selective pruning.
2. Expand native milkweed plantings at highway median strips (Hwy 1 corridor).
3. Install additional weather stations at 5 m and 15 m canopy heights.
4. Partner with citizen-science platform iNaturalist for broader re-sight data.
