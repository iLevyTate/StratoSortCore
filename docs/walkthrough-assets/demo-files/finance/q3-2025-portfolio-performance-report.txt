COMMENTARY
The portfolio outperformed the benchmark by 121 basis points in Q3, driven
primarily by our overweight in semiconductor and healthcare names. The August
volatility event (triggered by Bank of Japan rate concerns) was managed through
our systematic rebalancing discipline—we added to equities on the drawdown,
which contributed approximately 40 bps of alpha recovery.

Our alternatives sleeve delivered steady returns from the Sequoia Growth Fund IV
(vintage 2022), which marked up several portfolio companies after strong Q2
earnings. The real assets allocation benefited from falling interest rate
expectations, with REITs posting the strongest quarterly return across our sleeve.

OUTLOOK & RECOMMENDED ACTIONS
1. Reduce US Large-Cap Equity by 2% (take profits on semiconductor gains).
2. Increase International Developed by 2% (European value opportunity).
3. Maintain fixed-income duration at 5.2 years (anticipating Fed rate cuts).
4. Review high-yield exposure for credit quality deterioration signals.
