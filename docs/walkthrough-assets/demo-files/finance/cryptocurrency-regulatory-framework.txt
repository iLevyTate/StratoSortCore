EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The global regulatory landscape for digital assets has matured significantly
since the EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation took full effect in
December 2024. This paper provides a comparative analysis of cryptocurrency
regulatory frameworks across 12 major jurisdictions, evaluating their
approaches to consumer protection, anti-money laundering, stablecoin oversight,
and DeFi governance.

STABLECOIN REGULATION DEEP DIVE

Global stablecoin market cap: $178 billion (Aug 2025)
  - USDT (Tether): $95B (53%)
  - USDC (Circle): $52B (29%)
  - DAI (MakerDAO): $8.2B (5%)
  - Others: $22.8B (13%)

MiCA Requirements (EU):
  - 1:1 reserve backing in high-quality liquid assets (cash, government bonds)
  - Reserves held at EU credit institutions (30% minimum in cash)
  - Quarterly reserve attestations by independent auditors
  - €200M daily transaction cap for non-euro stablecoins (significant asset-
    referenced tokens)
  - Tether (USDT): Non-compliant as of June 2025; delisted from EU exchanges

US Approach:
  - OCC interpretive letter (Jan 2025): National banks may issue stablecoins
  - Lummis-Gillibrand Payment Stablecoin Act: Requires 100% reserves, monthly
    attestations, $10B issuer threshold for Fed oversight
  - Status: Committee markup completed; floor vote expected Q4 2025

DECENTRALIZED FINANCE (DeFi) CHALLENGES

Total Value Locked (DeFi): $148 billion (Aug 2025)
Top protocols: Lido ($38B), Aave ($22B), MakerDAO ($18B), Uniswap ($11B)

Regulatory questions unresolved:
1. Who is the "issuer" or "operator" of a decentralized protocol?
2. Can smart contract code constitute a "prospectus" or "white paper"?
3. How do KYC/AML requirements apply to non-custodial protocols?
4. Jurisdiction over DAOs with globally distributed token holders?

EU approach: European Commission study (due Dec 2025) evaluating whether MiCA
requires amendment for DeFi. Likely outcome: "same activity, same risk, same
regulation" with implementation guidance for protocol operators.

ENFORCEMENT STATISTICS (2023–2025)

Agency    | Actions Filed | Penalties Assessed | Key Cases
----------|---------------|--------------------|-----------
SEC (US)  |      78       |     $4.2B          | Coinbase, Binance
CFTC (US) |      34       |     $1.8B          | FTX settlement
DOJ (US)  |      22       |     $3.1B          | Binance (CZ plea)
FCA (UK)  |      15       |     £180M          | Unregistered exchanges
MAS (SG)  |       8       |     S$45M          | 3AC-related entities

CONSUMER PROTECTION METRICS

Estimated crypto fraud losses (global, 2024): $14.8 billion
  - Pig-butchering scams: $4.2B (28%)
  - Rug pulls / exit scams: $3.1B (21%)
  - Phishing / social engineering: $2.8B (19%)
  - Ponzi / yield schemes: $2.4B (16%)
  - Exchange hacks: $2.3B (16%)

POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS
1. Establish international stablecoin standards through FSB/IOSCO coordination.
2. Adopt activity-based (not entity-based) regulation for DeFi protocols.
3. Create regulatory sandboxes for tokenized real-world assets (RWA).
4. Mandate on-chain analytics for AML compliance (Chainalysis, Elliptic).
5. Harmonize tax reporting (OECD Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework by 2027).
