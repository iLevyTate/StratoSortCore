INVESTMENT THESIS
The AI accelerator market is entering a sustained growth phase driven by
enterprise AI adoption, sovereign AI infrastructure investment, and the
scaling requirements of frontier model training. We project the total
addressable market to grow from $68B (2024) to $320B by 2030, a 29% CAGR.

MARKET SEGMENTATION (2024 → 2030E)

Segment              | 2024 Revenue | 2030E Revenue | CAGR
---------------------|-------------|---------------|------
Data Center GPU      |   $47.5B    |   $185B       |  25%
Custom ASIC (TPU etc)|    $8.2B    |    $62B       |  40%
Edge AI Chips        |    $6.8B    |    $38B       |  33%
HBM Memory           |    $5.5B    |    $35B       |  36%

COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE

NVIDIA (NVDA) — Dominant Incumbent
  Market share (DC GPU): 88% (2024)
  Key product: Blackwell B200 ($30–40K ASP)
  Moat: CUDA ecosystem (4M+ developers), networking (Spectrum-X)
  Risk: Customer ASIC development (Google TPU, Amazon Trainium)
  Rating: Overweight | PT: $185

AMD (AMD) — Credible Challenger
  Market share (DC GPU): 9% (2024)
  Key product: MI350X (launching Q1 2026)
  Opportunity: ROCm 7 closing software gap; hyperscaler design wins
  Rating: Equal Weight | PT: $175

Intel (INTC) — Restructuring
  Market share (DC GPU): <2%
  Key product: Gaudi 3 (competitive TCO but limited adoption)
  Challenge: Foundry losses, management transition
  Rating: Underweight | PT: $22

Broadcom (AVGO) — Custom ASIC Leader
  Revenue: $4.2B from AI ASIC (Google, Meta, ByteDance)
  Opportunity: 3 additional hyperscaler engagements expected by 2026
  Rating: Overweight | PT: $230

SUPPLY CHAIN ANALYSIS

TSMC remains the critical bottleneck:
  - CoWoS advanced packaging capacity: ~35K wafers/month (2025)
  - Expanding to ~80K wafers/month by end of 2026
  - N3E (3nm) allocation for AI: 60% of total wafer starts

HBM (High Bandwidth Memory) suppliers:
  SK Hynix: 53% market share (HBM3E), sole supplier for NVIDIA B200
  Samsung: 38% market share, qualified for AMD MI350X
  Micron: 9% share, ramping HBM3E yield improvements

SOVEREIGN AI INVESTMENT WAVE

Country/Region    | Announced Investment | Timeline | Key Projects
------------------|---------------------|----------|---------------
Saudi Arabia      |     $100B           | 2025–30  | NEOM AI campus
UAE               |      $30B           | 2025–28  | G42 data centers
France            |      $25B           | 2025–30  | "AI France" plan
Japan             |      $13B           | 2025–27  | NVIDIA Blackwell cluster
India             |      $10B           | 2025–28  | IndiaAI Mission

RISKS TO THESIS
1. Export controls: Further US restrictions on China could reduce NVIDIA TAM
   by ~$15B annually (already reflected in our base case).
2. Model scaling plateau: If scaling laws diminish, training CAPEX could
   decelerate faster than inference growth compensates.
3. Power constraints: 1 GW+ data centers require utility-scale power; permitting
   delays could push installations out 12–18 months.

VALUATION SUMMARY
  NVDA: 35× FY2027E EPS = $185 PT (20% upside)
  AMD:  30× FY2027E EPS = $175 PT (8% upside)
  AVGO: 28× FY2027E EPS = $230 PT (15% upside)
  INTC: 18× FY2027E EPS = $22 PT (12% downside)
