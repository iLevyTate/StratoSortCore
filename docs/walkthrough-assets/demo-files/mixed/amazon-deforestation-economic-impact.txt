Amazon Deforestation and Its Economic Impact on Global Carbon Markets

World Resources Institute | Policy Brief No. 42, July 2025

SUMMARY
Between 2001 and 2024, the Brazilian Amazon lost approximately 230,000 km² of
primary forest—an area larger than the United Kingdom. This policy brief
quantifies the economic externalities of continued deforestation through the
lens of carbon credit markets, agricultural commodity supply chains, and
ecosystem service valuation.

CARBON ECONOMICS
  Carbon stored in Amazon biomass: ~150 billion tonnes CO₂e
  Annual emissions from deforestation (2020–2024 avg): 1.1 Gt CO₂e
  Social Cost of Carbon (US EPA, 2025): $230/tonne CO₂e
  Implied annual externality: $253 billion

The voluntary carbon market valued Amazonian REDD+ credits at $8–15/tonne in
2024, a fraction of the social cost. The EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism
(CBAM), effective 2026, will increase the effective price of embedded
deforestation carbon in agricultural exports to the EU to ~€90/tonne.

AGRICULTURAL TRADE IMPACTS
Brazil exported $47B in soybeans and $12B in beef in 2024. The EU Deforestation
Regulation (EUDR) requires supply-chain traceability to plot-level coordinates
by January 2026. Compliance costs are estimated at $1.2B for the Brazilian
agricultural sector, but non-compliance risks $6.8B in annual EU market access.

ECOSYSTEM SERVICE VALUATION
  Service                  | Value ($/ha/year) | Total Amazon Value
  -------------------------|-------------------|-------------------
  Carbon sequestration     |     $1,800        |  $630 billion
  Water cycling            |       $720        |  $252 billion
  Biodiversity (existence) |       $340        |  $119 billion
  Pollination services     |       $180        |   $63 billion
  Flood regulation         |       $150        |   $53 billion

RECOMMENDATIONS
1. Align carbon credit pricing with social cost of carbon through compliance
   market integration.
2. Support Brazil's PPCDAm enforcement with $500M multilateral funding.
3. Accelerate EUDR implementation with technical assistance for smallholders.
4. Invest in high-resolution satellite monitoring (Planet, NICFI partnership).
