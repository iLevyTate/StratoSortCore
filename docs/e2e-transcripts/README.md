# E2E Video Transcripts

Narrative transcripts for StratoSort Core walkthrough videos. Use these for:

- **VoiceOver recording** — Read aloud for accessibility
- **Closed captions** — Adapt for subtitles
- **Script reference** — When re-recording or editing videos

## Format

Each transcript is a markdown file matching the video filename (e.g. `01_welcome_and_setup_walkthrough.md` for `01_welcome_and_setup_walkthrough.mp4`). The content describes on-screen actions and UI elements in sequential order, written for spoken delivery.
