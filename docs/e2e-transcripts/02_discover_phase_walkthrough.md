## Transcript

The StratoSort app is on the Discover phase. The navigation bar shows Welcome, Setup, Discover, Organize, and Complete. Discover is selected.

In the upper-right corner, two buttons are visible: "Naming Strategy" and "Knowledge OS." The main area shows options to add files: "Select Files" and "Scan Folder."

The user clicks "Naming Strategy." A modal opens titled "Naming Strategy." The modal shows settings for file naming: Convention with options like subject-date, date-subject, and subject-only; Date Format with YYYY-MM-DD, MM-DD-YYYY, and DD-MM-YYYY; Case with kebab-case, snake_case, camelCase, and Title Case; and Separator with dash, dot, underscore, and none. A live preview shows the resulting filename format. The user closes the modal.

The user clicks "Knowledge OS." The Knowledge OS panel slides in from the right. Three tabs appear: Discover, Understand, and Relate. The Discover tab is selected. A search bar and status message indicate the number of folders and files indexed. The panel explains that Knowledge OS enables semantic search across analyzed files. The user closes the panel.

The user clicks "Select Files." A file picker dialog opens. The user navigates to a directory and selects multiple files. The selection is confirmed.

Back on the Discover screen, the selected files appear in a queue. A progress indicator shows "Analyzing" with a file counter. A "Stop Analysis" button is visible. A toast notification appears: "Added N new files for analysis" and "Starting AI analysis of N files."

The analysis progress bar advances. The walkthrough ends with analysis in progress.
