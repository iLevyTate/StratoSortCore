## Transcript

AI analysis has completed. The Discover phase shows a green status: "Analysis complete" with the number of files ready. A toast notification confirms "Analysis complete! N files ready."

The user navigates to the Organize phase. The Organize screen displays a grid of file cards. Each card shows the original filename, a "Ready" badge, the AI-suggested name, a Category dropdown, and a confidence percentage in green. A "Details" link opens the full AI analysis for each file.

Example suggestions are visible: an invoice file suggested as "consulting-invoice" with 100% confidence; meeting notes suggested as "product-plan-session-notes" with 95% confidence; an onboarding checklist with 100% confidence. The Category dropdown lets the user change the destination folder for each file.

Batch operations are available: "Select All," "Approve Selected," "Bulk Edit," and "Deselect All." The user can approve suggestions individually or in bulk.

The user clicks the Search button to open Knowledge OS. The Knowledge OS panel shows the Discover tab with indexed files. The status bar reads "N folders, N files indexed."

The user types "invoice" in the search bar. Search results appear. A file matching "invoice" is highlighted with tags: consulting, invoice, business, and confidence score. A file preview shows content and path. "View in Graph" and "Ask AI" buttons are available.

The user clears the search and types "meeting notes about product planning." Natural language search returns relevant files. A meeting notes file appears with 95% confidence, tags like "product planning" and "meeting notes," and a full content preview. The "Open File" button is visible.

The demo shows that AI analysis, Organize suggestions, and Knowledge OS semantic search work together in the production AppImage.
