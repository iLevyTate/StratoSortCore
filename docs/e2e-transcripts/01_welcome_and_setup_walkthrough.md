The StratoSort Core window opens in full screen. The Welcome screen displays the StratoSort logo at the top with a green connection indicator showing the AI engine is ready.

Below the logo, four phase tabs are visible: Welcome, Setup, Discover, Organize, and Complete. The Welcome tab is selected. A search button and settings gear icon sit in the top-right corner.

The main Welcome area shows three action buttons: "Organize files now," "AI and model settings," and "Configure smart folders." A link reads "How does StratoSort work?"

The user clicks "How does StratoSort work?" A modal dialog appears with the title "How does StratoSort work?" The modal explains three steps: Discover — drop folders, run system scans, or watch Downloads automatically; Analyze — local AI reads file contents, context, and prior choices; Organize — approve suggestions, rename intelligently, undo instantly. The user closes the modal.

The user clicks "Configure smart folders" and navigates to the Setup phase. The Setup screen shows a list of Smart Folders. A default "Uncategorized" folder appears with its path. An "Add Folder" button is visible.

The user clicks "Add Folder." The Add Smart Folder dialog opens with fields for Folder Name, Target Path, and Description. A "Generate with AI" button is available for the description. The user enters a folder name and path, then confirms.

The Setup phase now shows multiple Smart Folders. A "Continue to Discovery" button appears at the bottom. The user clicks it and navigates to the Discover phase.

The Discover phase displays the file import area with options to select files or scan a folder. The walkthrough ends on the Discover screen.
