## Transcript

The StratoSort app is open. The user clicks the search button in the navigation bar. A floating Search widget appears. The widget explains Knowledge OS capabilities: semantic search, natural language queries, and document relationships. An "Open Knowledge OS" button is prominent. A keyboard shortcut is shown: Ctrl+K to open search from anywhere.

The user closes the widget and clicks the settings gear icon. The Settings panel opens as a slide-out panel from the right. Six collapsible sections are visible: AI Configuration, Performance, Default Locations, Application, Analysis History, and Diagnostics.

The user expands the AI Configuration section. It shows the Local AI Engine status — Ready with CPU or GPU — and model selection for Text, Vision, and Embedding models. GPU Acceleration toggle and model management options are visible.

The user scrolls through the Settings panel. Each section can be expanded to reveal detailed options. The Performance section includes Auto-Organize, Background Mode, and Processing Limits. Default Locations covers Smart Folder base path and naming defaults. Application includes Launch on Startup and Software Updates. Notifications, Backup and Restore, Analysis History, and Diagnostics complete the panel.

The user closes Settings and clicks the Search button again. The Knowledge OS full interface opens. The Discover tab shows the search bar and indexed file count. The user can type natural language queries to find files. The walkthrough ends with the Knowledge OS interface open.
