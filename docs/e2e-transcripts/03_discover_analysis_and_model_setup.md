The StratoSort Model Setup Wizard is displayed. This screen appears on first launch when required AI models are not yet installed.

The wizard shows a table of models: Embedding Model, Text Analysis Model, and Vision Model. Each row displays the model name, purpose, installation status — Installed or Not installed — and download size. Checkboxes allow selecting which models to download.

Three action buttons appear at the bottom: "Download Models," "Refresh," and "Continue with limited AI."

The user clicks "Download Models." Progress bars appear for each selected model. Each bar shows the model name, download speed in megabytes per second, and a percentage complete. The embedding model and text model progress bars fill as downloads proceed.

The user can also click "Continue with limited AI" to skip setup and enter the app immediately. The app will download models in the background while the user explores.

The wizard is dismissed. The app transitions to the Discover phase. The user clicks "Scan Folder." A folder picker opens. The user selects a directory. StratoSort discovers all supported files within that folder and adds them to the analysis queue.

The Discover screen shows the file queue with an "Analyzing" progress indicator. The walkthrough demonstrates that model setup and file discovery work together seamlessly.
