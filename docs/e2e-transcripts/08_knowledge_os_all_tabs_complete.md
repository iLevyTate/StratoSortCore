## Transcript

The Knowledge OS panel is open with all three tabs demonstrated.

**Discover Tab.** The default tab. A search bar at the top with placeholder text for natural language queries. The results list shows files ranked by semantic relevance with confidence scores. Clicking a result displays the file preview on the right: content, tags, and action buttons including "View in Graph" and "Ask AI." The status bar shows folder count and indexed file count.

**Understand Tab.** The user clicks the Understand tab. This is the AI conversational chat interface. A "New Chat" button and search-for-chats field are visible. The chat input reads "Ask a question about your documents." The user types a question such as "What is this invoice about?" and sends it.

The AI responds with "Searching documents..." then "Found N relevant sources." The response includes an answer drawn from the indexed documents. Source citations or file references may appear. This is RAG — Retrieval-Augmented Generation — chat over your local files.

**Relate Tab.** The user clicks the Relate tab. The Knowledge Graph visualization appears. The left panel shows graph controls: current graph stats — Nodes and Links — Insights panel, Add to Graph search, and Explore, Actions, and Advanced sections. A three-step tutorial may be visible for first-time users.

The center canvas displays an interactive node-link diagram. Clusters of related files appear as grouped nodes. A "Clusters On/Off" toggle controls cluster visibility. Zoom and pan controls are available. Double-clicking a cluster expands it to show individual file nodes with relationship edges.

The right panel shows the legend: Node Types — Cluster in orange, File in blue, Query in purple; Connection Logic — Shared Tags, Same Category, Content Match, Vector Similarity; File Categories — Documents, Images, Audio, Spreadsheets, Code, Videos; Cluster confidence indicators.

Clicking a cluster reveals details: file count, confidence level, "WHY THIS CLUSTER" with common tags, and "WHY CONNECTED" with per-file connection reasons. "Show only cluster" and "Show neighbors" buttons refine the view.

The Insights panel displays organizational metrics: topic clusters count, bridge documents, near-duplicates, scattered files, and Organizational Health score from A to F with percentage.

The walkthrough concludes with the full Knowledge Graph and legend visible, demonstrating all three Knowledge OS tabs: Discover for search, Understand for AI chat, and Relate for the graph.
